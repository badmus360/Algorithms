//Description:
//        John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper.
//        He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
//
//        John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters,
//        a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
//        The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters.
//        The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind however,
//        that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy
//        in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants
//        to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
//
//        Last time he did these calculations he got a headache,
//        so could you help John?
